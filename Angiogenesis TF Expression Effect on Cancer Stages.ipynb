    "* Our hallmark of interest is sustained angiogenesis, which is the process of growing new blood cells. In a healthy case, angiogenesis may occur to heal damaged tissue by supplying it with oxygen and nutrients. Similarly, it can nourish cancer cells and promote their growth and spread. Often, angiogenesis is seen in the early stages of many cancers. There is usually a balance between angiogenesis promoters, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF1/2), and inhibitors, such as thrombospondin-1; however, this balance is disrupted with cancer. VEGF and FGFs have greater expression while thrombospondin-1 has decreased expression. We will focus on VEGF. These growth factors bind to transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors on endothelial cells, which are involved in cell proliferation. The binding of VEGF on tyrosine kinase receptors triggers a signal-transduction cascade that activates the ras oncogene and the downstream effectors that further promote more growth factors.\n",

Depending on your decision, update this section to include relevant information about the disease at the appropriate level of detail. Regardless, each bullet point should be filled in. If you are looking at multiple cancer types, you should investigate differences between the types (e.g. what is the most prevalent cancer type? What type has the highest mortality rate?) and similarities (e.g. what sorts of treatments exist across the board for cancer patients? what is common to all cancers in terms of biological mechanisms?).
